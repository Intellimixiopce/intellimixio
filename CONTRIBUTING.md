## Create a branch

Change to the repository directory on your computer (if you are not already there):

Now create a branch using the `git checkout` command:

git checkout -b hacktober2022
```

## Make necessary changes and commit those changes

If you go to the project directory and execute the command 

`git status`, 
you'll see there are changes.

#### The Red there is to be commited / that are the changes which are not pulled to main/master or any other branch.

So Lets add those changes with these command lines:
`git add` 
or 
`git add -A`

Now commit those changes using the `git commit` command:

```
git commit -m "<Your commmit message>"
```
## Push changes to GitHub

Push your changes using the command `git push`:

```
git push origin -u <add-your-branch-name>
```

replacing `<add-your-branch-name>` with the name of the branch you created earlier.
