Hacktoberfest is a month-long celebration of open-source projects, their maintainers, and the entire community of contributors. Itâ€™s a time to contribute to open source, improve your skills, and build greater technology in the process.
This online event has been happening every October for the last nine years and is sponsored by DigitalOcean. Last year Hacktoberfest witnessed a total of 294,451 successfully merged pull requests and 141,802 registered participants.

Itâ€™s free to participate in and open to everyone in the world. Whether you are a programmer, designer, writer, tester, translator, artist, or simply someone who wants to learn more about software development, any contribution is appreciated!

Whether Itâ€™s Your First Timeâ€”Or Your Ninthâ€” Itâ€™s Time To Hack Out! Sign up for Hacktoberfest 2022 and start contributing!

# Whatâ€™s new this year?
Contributing to open source isnâ€™t just for technical folks who want to write code. There are many opportunities to use your professional skills to support open-source projects. This year, Hacktoberfest is trying to encourage contributions that require some technical experience or none. No matter your experience, you can participate in Hacktoberfest!

## New to open source?
Hacktoberfest is a great place to start dipping your toes into open source contributions for the first time. There are several streams, essays, tips, and discussions on getting started. Youâ€™ll be joining many other people who are beginning their trip this month!
