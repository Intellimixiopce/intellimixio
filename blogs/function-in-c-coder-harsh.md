In this post we will know in detail about Function in C, what are the types of functions and how can we use a function in C program along with an example. So, letâ€™s read the post which helps you to understand a function in C programming.

**Introduction**: In C programming, Function is the group or block of statements that repeat together to perform tasks. Generally, if we have to repeat the same kind of tasks multiple times then we use function instant of writing those codes again & again. Every c program has at least one function named main (). In other words, we can say that function is the collection of statements enclosed by {}.

**Benefits of function in C** 

- We can save time by avoiding writing the same codes multiple times. 
- We can call a function multiple times according to our needs.  
- Reusability of code is the main benefit of creating a function.
- The C standard library provides various built-in functions that we can call in our program. For example, we can use the strlwr() function from the string library which returns the length of a string.
- We can analyse & understand the large program easily when a program is divided into multiple functions.

**Key terms of a function**

There are three important terms in a C function

- **Function declaration**: A function must be declared globally in a c program to tell the compiler about the function name, function parameters, and return type.
- **Function call**: Function can be called from anywhere in the program. The parameter list must not differ in function calling and function declaration. We must pass the same number of functions as it is declared in the function declaration.
- **Function definition**: It contains the actual statements which are to be executed. It is the most important aspect to which the control comes when the function is called. Here, we must notice that only one value can be returned from the function.
- **Return type**: A function may return a value. The return type is the data type of the value the function returns. Some functions perform the desired operations without returning a value. In this case, the return type is the keyword void.
- **Parameters**: When a function is invoked, you pass a value to the parameter. This value is referred to as an actual parameter or argument. The parameter list refers to the type, order, and the number of the parameters of a function. Parameters are optional; that is, a function may contain no parameters.

**Types of Functions**

There are two types of functions in C programming

1. **Library Functions**: Library Functions are the functions which are declared in the C header files such as scanf(), printf(), gets(), puts() etc.
2. **User-defined functions**: User-defined functions are the functions that are created by the C programmer so that he/she can use them many times. It reduces the complexity of a big program and optimizes the code.

**Different aspects of function calling**

A function may or may not accept any argument. It may or may not return any value. Based on these facts, there are four different aspects of function calls. 

- **Function without arguments and without return value**
- **Function without arguments and with return value**
- **Function with arguments and without return value** 
- **Function with arguments and with return value**

**Function without arguments and without return value**: We can use the function without passing any arguments and the function will not return any value in this aspect of function calls.

**Function without arguments and with return value**: We can use the function without passing any arguments and the function will return any value in this aspect of function calls.

**Function with arguments and without return value**: We can use the function with passing any arguments and the function will not return any value in this aspect of function calls.

**Function with arguments and return value**: We can use the function with passing any arguments and the function will return any value to the compiler in this aspect of function calls.

**Function Arguments**:

If a function will use arguments, it must declare variables that accept the values of the arguments. These variables are called formal parameters. Formal parameters behave like local variables inside the function and are created upon entry into the function and destroyed upon exit. While calling a function, there are three ways in which arguments can be passed to a function.

**Call by value**: In call by value when we pass the formal value to the function, then it reflects the actual arguments.

   **Example**

**Call by reference**: In call by reference, when we pass the formal value to the function, then it does not reflect the actual arguments.

   **Example**

**Call by address**: In call by address, when we pass the address value to the function, then it does not reflect the actual arguments.
