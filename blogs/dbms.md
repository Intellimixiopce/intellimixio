<h1>INTRODUCTION TO DBMS: </h1>

<h2>What is data?</h2>

- Data is nothing but facts and statistics stored or free flowing over a network, 
generally it's raw and unprocessed. 
- Data becomes information when it is processed, turning it into something 
meaningful. 
- What is database: The database is a collection of inter-related data which is used to 
retrieve, insert and delete the data efficiently. 
- It is also used to organize the data in the form of a table, schema, views, and 
reports, etc. 
- Using the database, you can easily retrieve, insert, and delete the information. 
- For example: The college Database organizes the data about the admin, staff, 
students and faculty etc. 

<h2>What is dbms? </h2>

- A DBMS is software that allows creation, definition and manipulation of database, 
allowing users to store, process and analyse data easily. 
- DBMS provides us with an interface or a tool, to perform various operations like 
creating database, storing data in it, updating data, creating tables in the database 
and a lot more. 
- DBMS also provides protection and security to the databases. 
- It also maintains data consistency in case of multiple users. 


**Here are some examples of popular DBMS used these days:**
1. MySql 
2. Oracle 
3. SQL Server 
4. IBM DB2


<h1>DATABASE APPLICATIONS â€“ DBMS:</h1> 

**Applications where we use Database Management Systems are:**
- ``Industry:`` Where it is a manufacturing unit, warehouse or distribution centre, each 
one needs a database to keep the records of ins and outs 
- ``Banking System:`` For storing customer info, tracking day to day credit and debit 
transactions, generating bank statements etc. 
- ``Sales:`` To store customer information, production information and invoice details. 
- ``Railways:`` To travel though railways, we make early reservations; this reservation 
information along with train schedule is stored in database. 
- ``Education sector:`` Database systems are frequently used in schools and colleges to 
store and retrieve the data regarding student details, staff details, course details, 
exam details, payroll data, attendance details, fees details etc.

<h2>Characteristics of DBMS</h2> 

- Data stored into Tables: Data is never directly stored into the database. Data is 
stored into tables, created inside the database. 
- Reduced Redundancy: In the modern world hard drives are very cheap, but earlier 
when hard drives were too expensive, unnecessary repetition of data in database 
was a big problem. But DBMS follows Normalisation which divides the data in 
such a way that repetition is minimum. 
- Data Consistency: On Live data, i.e. data that is being continuosly updated and 
added, maintaining the consistency of data can become a challenge. But DBMS 
handles it all by itself. 
- Support Multiple user and Concurrent Access: DBMS allows multiple users to 
work on it(update, insert, delete data) at the same time and still manages to 
maintain the data consistency. 
- Query Language: DBMS provides users with a simple Query language, using which data can be easily fetched, inserted, deleted and updated in a database. 


``Advantages of DBMS`` 

- **Controls database redundancy:** It can control data redundancy because it stores all 
the data in one single database file and that recorded data is placed in the database. 
- **Data sharing:** In DBMS, the authorized users of an organization can share the data 
among multiple users. 
- **Easily Maintenance:** It can be easily maintainable due to the centralized nature of 
the database system. 
- **Reduce time:** It reduces development time and maintenance need. 
- **Backup:** It provides backup and recovery subsystems which create automatic 
backup of data from hardware and software failures and restores the data if 
required. 
- **multiple user interface:** It provides different types of user interfaces like graphical 
user interfaces, application program interfaces.

``Disadvantages of DBMS`` 
- **Cost of Hardware and Software:** It requires a high speed of data processor and 
large memory size to run DBMS software. 
- **Size:** It occupies a large space of disks and large memory to run them efficiently. 
- **Complexity:** Database system creates additional complexity and requirements. 
- **Higher impact of failure:** Failure is highly impacted the database because in most 
of the organization, all the data stored in a single database and if the database is 
damaged due to electric failure or database corruption then the data may be lost 
forever.
