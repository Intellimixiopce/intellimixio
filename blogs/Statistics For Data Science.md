<h1>Why Should I Learn Statistics?</h1>

Variation is an inevitability facet of life!  Every process has variation.High variation means low quality. 
**Decision makers make better decisions when they use all available information in an effective and
meaningful way. The primary role of statistics is to provide decision makers with methods for obtaining and
analyzing information to help make these decisions. Statistics is used to answer long-range planning
questions, such as when and where to locate facilities to handle future sales.**


**Just like weather, if we cannot control something, We should learn how to measure and analyze in
order to predict it, effectively.**

``The aim of this blog is to provide you with hands-on
experience to promote the use of statistical thinking and techniques to apply them to make educated decisions
whenever you encounter variation in business data.``

<h1>What Is Business Statistics?</h1>

The main objective of Business Statistics is to make inferences (predictions, decisions) about certain
characteristics of a population based on information contained in a random sample.

Business Statistics is the science of "good" decision making in the face of uncertainty and is used in many
disciplines, such as financial analysis, econometrics, auditing, production and operations, and marketing
research. It provides knowledge and skills to interpret and use statistical techniques in a variety of business
applications. 
- Carefully planned statistical studies remove hindrances to high quality and productivity at every stage of
production, saving time and money. It is well recognized that quality must be engineered into products as
early as possible in the design process. One must know how to use carefully planned, cost-effective
experiments to improve, optimize and make robust products/services and processes data.

Statistical topics are about decision-making with respect to the characteristics of a group of persons or objects
on the basis of numerical information obtained from a randomly selected sample of the group.

<h1>Types of Statistical Analyses:</h1>

- ``Descriptive Statistics`` is concerned with summary calculations, graphs, charts, and tables.

- ``Inferential Statistics`` is a method used to generalize from a sample to a population. For example, the
average income of all families in the US (the population) can be estimated from figures obtained from a
few hundred families (the sample).


<h2>Statistical Population:</h2> A statistical population is the collection of all possible observations with a specified
characteristic of interest.
**An example :**  all the students in the College is population then ECE, Computer Science ,1st year,2nd Year and etc, are the sample. Note
that a sample is a subset of the population.
<h2>Variable:</h2>A variable is an item of interest that can take on many different values.

<h1>Types of Variables or Data:</h1>

- ``Qualitative Variables`` are non-numerical variables that cannot be measured. Examples include gender,
religious affiliation, place of birth.

- ``Quantitative Variables`` are numerical variables that can be measured. Examples include balance in
your checking account, number of children in your larger family. Note that quantitative variables are
either discrete (which can assume only certain values, and there are usually "gaps" between the values,
such as the number of bedrooms in your house) or continuous (which can assume any value within a
specific range, such as the air pressure in a tire).
