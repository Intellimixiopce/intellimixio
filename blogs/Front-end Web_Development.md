<h1>Front-end web development:</h1>

Front-end web development, also known as client-side development is the 
practice of producing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for a website or Web 
Application so that a user can see and interact with them directly. The 
objective of designing a site is to ensure that when the users open up the site, 
they see the information in a format that is easy to read and relevant. This is 
further complicated by the fact that users now use a large variety of devices 
with varying screen sizes and resolutions thus forcing the designer to take into 
consideration these aspects when designing the site. They need to ensure that 
their site comes up correctly in different browsers (cross-browser), different 
operating systems (cross-platform), and different devices (cross-device), 
which requires careful planning on the side of the developer. A front-end 
developer architects and develops websites and applications using web 
technologies (i.e., HTML, CSS, DOM, and JavaScript), which run on the Open 
Web Platform or act as compilation input for non-web platform environments 
(i.e., React Native)


<h1>➢ HTML</h1> 

The backbone of any website development process, web pages cannot exist 
without Hypertext Mark-up Language (HTML). 
Hypertext means that the text has links, called hyperlinks, embedded in it. So, when 
a user clicks on a word or a phrase that has a hyperlink, it leads him/ her to another 
web page. A mark-up language also means that the text can be converted into 
images, tables, links, and other representations. The overall framework of how the 
site will look is written in HTML code. 
 HTML is the language for describing the structure of Web pages. 
Using HTML, we can create a Web page with text, graphics, sound, and video. HTML 
provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics 
for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes, and other items. 


<h2>The meaning of each word of HTML:</h2>

- **Hypertext:** Text (often with embeds such as images, too) that is organized in order to connect related items.
- **Markup:** a style guide for typesetting anything to be printed in hardcopy or soft copy format.
- **Language:** a language that a computer system understands and uses to interpret commands. 

<h2>Key terms of  HTML</h2>
  
- **HTML TAGS:** HTML has "tags" that let you get this done. So, there are tags to create headings,paragraphs, bolded words, italicized words, and more. 
- **HTML ELEMENTS:** An element consists of the opening tag, a character, the content, and a closing tag. Some elements are empty – that is, they don't have a closing tag but instead have a source or link to content that you want to embed on the web page. An example of an empty element is <img>, which you use to embed images on a web page. 
- **HTML ATTRIBUTES:** HTML tags also take what are called attributes. These attributes are placed in the opening tag and range from style and ids to classes. They take values, which convey more information about the element and help you do things such as styling and manipulation with JavaScript. 


In the infographic below, the opening tag contains a class attribute with a value 
of “text”. This can be used to style the element or select it with JavaScript for 
interactivity. 

<h1>Here's the basic HTML page:</h1>

```

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
 <head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    
  <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge" />
    
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    
  <title>Definition of HTML</title>
 </head>
 
 <body>
   <!--Page content such as text and images goes in here-->
 </body>
 
</html> 
```

##
- The <!DOCTYPE html> declaration defines this document to be HTML5.
- The < html > element is the root element of an HTML page. 
- The < head > element contains meta information about the document. 
- The < title > element specifies a title for the document. 
- The < body > element contains the visible page content.
- The < h1 > element defines a large heading.
- The < p > element defines a paragraph.
- HTML tags are element names surrounded by angle brackets:  <tagname>content goes here...< /tagname>

HTML determines the structure of web pages. This structure alone is not enough to
make a web page look good and interactive. So, we'll use assisted technologies such
as CSS and JavaScript to make your HTML beautiful and add interactivity,
respectively.
  
  <h1>        ➢ CSS (Cascading Style Sheets):</h1>
Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) are used to format the layout of a webpage. With CSS, you
can control the color, font, the size of text, the spacing between elements, how elements
are positioned and laid out, what background images or background colors are to be
used, different displays for different devices and screen sizes, and much more!
  
  
  <h3> CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:</h3>
  
-   Inline - by using the style attribute in HTML elements. An inline CSS is used to apply a unique style to a single HTML element.Ex.: < h1 style="color: blue;">This is a Blue Heading</h1 >
-   Internal - by using a <style> element in the <head> section. Aninternal CSS is used to define a style for a single HTML page. Aninternal CSS is defined in the<head> section of an HTML page, within a <style> element.Ex:<style>body {background-color: powder blue;}h1 {color: blue;}p {color: red;}
-   External - by using an external CSS file. An external style sheet is used to define the style for many HTML pages. With an external style sheet, you can change the look of an entire website, by changing one file! To use an external style sheet, add a link to it in the <head> section of the HTML page. Ex: <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
  
  
  <h1>➢ JavaScript</h1>
  A multi-paradigm language, JavaScript supports event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. It is used to transform a static HTML page into a dynamic interface. JavaScript code can use the DOM to manipulate a web page in response to events, such as user input. JavaScript code can also actively retrieve content from the web as well as react to server-side events using a technique called AJAX. An essential part of web applications, most websites use it for client-side page behavior and all major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute it.

- Loosely typed scripting language.
- JavaScript function is called when an event occurs on a page.
  
##
  
**In this case, if we break down the three technologies – HTML, CSS, and JavaScript –like a human body.**
  
- HTML is the skeleton.
- CSS is the skin.
- JavaScript is the circulatory, digestive, and respiratory systems that bring the structure and the skin to life.

  <h1> ➢ Frameworks and Libraries</h1>
  
A web framework (WF) or web application framework (WAF) is a software
framework that is designed to support the development of web applications
including web services, web resources, and web APIs.
Web frameworks provide a standard way to build and deploy web applications on
the World Wide Web. Web frameworks aim to automate the overhead associated
with common activities performed in web development.
For example, many web frameworks provide libraries for database access,
templating frameworks, and session management, and they often promote code
reuse. Although they often target the development of dynamic websites, they are
also applicable to static websites.

 <h1>❖ Bootstrap</h1>
• Bootstrap is the most popular HTML, CSS, and JavaScript framework for
developing a responsive and mobile-friendly website.
 
• It is free to download and use.
 
• It is very easy to use. Anybody having basic knowledge of HTML and CSS can use
Bootstrap.
 
• It is a front-end framework used for easier and faster web development.
