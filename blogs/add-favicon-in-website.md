In this blog, I have explained how to add a favicon to any website or webpage, so let's read the blog to get the idea for adding a favicon to the website.

at first, you have to add the following line inside the <head> tag with the appropriate path of the favicon image.

  

<link rel="icon" type="image/x-icon" href="fevicon.png">





That's it, you have done and now you can view the favicon icon in the browser of your website.
