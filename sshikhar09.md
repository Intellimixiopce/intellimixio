# Web Development

Web development is the field of static as well as dynamic website development.
Done properly, it has the potential to help a significant amount of people just because of its functionality. In the age of mobile apps, web development still stands strong because a large number of people still use a computer/laptop as their primary internet usage device.
It is a diverse field, with many language in the market to work on. It has many frameworks which can be used according to convenience to make the project that one desires.
However, the core of web development lies in three languages which are used as fundamentals. These are HTML, CSS and JAVASCRIPT.

# HTML

 It is the language which provides structure to the website. It specifies which part of the website is going to be where, how much length it will have, how much breadth and what will be its content.
 Some minor styling could be done using HTML but it was very limited. Thus, static websited were created during the '90s using just HTML. No data transaction could happen
 and no interaction could be processed between the server and the user. This was the time of web 1.0. However, slowly the times progressed and the age of web 2.0 dawned.
 
 # CSS
 
 It was the time when some coloring, decoration and artistic touch was to be added to the websites made by people. Thus, CSS was created. This language allowed people to add style to the website.
 This contained how a particular element would look, its colors, its dimensions and somewhat its responsiveness. The responsiveness of a website means how the website would look under different dimensions of screen size.
 If a website was being rendered on a laptop then it would have a larger size, while on a phone the UI had to be changed accordingly, This functionality was handled by something called the media queries. But still, the websites were static and could not be used to take an input, process it and provide the answer on the screen.
 
 # JAVASCRIPT
 
 This was the time when the internet moved to the  stage that we currently live in. The age of web 2.0. This is the age of functionality and interaction. Javascript allowed the user to enter a data, take the data as input, store it, process it, perform operations on it and print the result on the screen as required by the user.
 This made possible many interactive websites, web games and even social media platforms. Javascript is the original founder of a lot of other languages.
 
 Although, javascript is very good, it is too lengthy to write vanilla javascript. Thus, many frmaeworks are present today in the market, like Vue, React etc. which allow alternate shorter syntax to write the same javascript code.
 
 # Future Prospects
 
 As we move to the next stage of web, i.e., Web 3.0, we see many new features such as blockchain developing, etc, which is giving new boost to web development as every developer first wants to apply this field to web development first.
 This will bost web development and ensure that the field never dies out, even many many years after it was founded.
